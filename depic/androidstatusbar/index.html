        ColorBubble is a flat and simple theme for minimalists, focused on detail. As of right now, ColorBubble only supports a couple of handfuls of stock icons, but I am trying as hard as I can to support as many icons as I can without rushing development and halfing my effort. <p><br>Also keep in mind ColorBubble is still in beta, and I have to go to school.</p>

        Installing this theme depends on Anemone. You can install Anemone for free from the BigBoss repo.
